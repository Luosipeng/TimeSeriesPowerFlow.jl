bus1 = Bus(1, "Bus 1", 110.0, "b", 1, 1.0, 0.0)
bus2 = Bus(2, "Bus 2", 110.0, "pq", 1, 1.0, 0.0)
push!(case.busesAC, bus1)
push!(case.busesAC, bus2)

# Add generator
gen = StaticGenerator(1, "Gen 1", 1, 100.0, 20.0, 1.0, 150.0, 50.0, 50.0, -50.0)
push!(case.sgensAC, gen)

# Add line
line = Line(1, "Line 1-2", 1, 2, 10.0, 0.1, 0.3, 10.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1)
push!(case.branchesAC, line)

# Add load
load = Load(1, "Load 1", 2, 50.0, 10.0, 1.0, "wye")
push!(case.loadsAC, load)

# Convert to JPC format
jpc = JuliaPowerCase2Jpc(case)

# Set power flow options
opt = PowerFlow.settings()
opt[:pf_alg] = :NR  # Newton-Raphson algorithm
opt[:verbose] = 1

# Run power flow
